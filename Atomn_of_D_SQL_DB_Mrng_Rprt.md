## *Introduction*

The manual process of generating and sending the *Daily SQL Database Morning Report* was a time-intensive task, taking approximately *1 hour* to cover *seven servers*. To streamline this process, an automated solution was developed to perform the necessary checks, compile the report, and send it via email automatically. This automation has reduced the time required for this task to just *20-30 seconds*, significantly enhancing efficiency and productivity.

---

## *Objectives*

1. *Automate* the generation of the *Daily SQL Database Morning Report.*  
2. Minimize the *time and effort* required to perform database health checks across multiple servers.  
3. Ensure *timely and accurate* reporting to the database team.  

---

## *Scope*

The automation solution includes the following features:

- *Cluster Status Check:* Verifies the overall health of the SQL clusters.  
- *Disk Space Status Check:* Monitors and reports on disk space usage.  
- *SQL Health Status Check:* Assesses the performance and health of SQL databases.  
- *Server Login Status Check:* Validates login functionality for each server.  
- *Automated Email Reporting:* Compiles the results into a formatted email and sends it daily at *9:00 AM.*  

---

## *Implementation Details*

1. *Automated Script Development:*  
   - Developed a script using SQL queries to perform the required checks for *cluster, disk space, server login,* and *SQL health statuses.*  
   - Structured the results into a comprehensive report.  

2. *Job Scheduling:*  
   - Configured a job scheduler to run the script daily at *9:00 AM.*  
   - Ensured error handling and logging mechanisms for reliability.  

3. *Email Automation:*  
   - Integrated an email notification system to send the generated report to the database team.  
   - Designed a clear and professional email format for the report.  

4. *Performance Optimization:*  
   - Optimized the queries and report generation process to handle multiple servers efficiently within *20-30 seconds.*

## *Email Example*

**Subject:** *Daily SQL Database Morning Report*  

**Email Body:**  

*Dear Team,*  

Please find below the *Daily SQL Database Morning Report:*  

| *Host Name* | *IP*         | *Overall Cluster* | *Overall Disk Space Status* | *SQL Health Status* | *Server Login Status* |  
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|  
| ABCDEFGHI          | 10.10.10.10 | Yes                 | OK                             | Good                  | Yes                     |  

### *Evaluation Details:*  
- *Cluster Status:*  
  - *OK:* All nodes are UP.  
  - *Not OK:* One or more nodes are not UP.  
  - *Not Available:* The server is not part of a cluster.  

- *Disk Space Status:*  
  - *OK:* All drives have > 10 GB of free space.  
  - *Not OK:* At least one drive has < 10 GB of free space.  

*This is an automated email. For any discrepancies, please contact the database team.*  

*Best regards,*

## *Results and Impact*

The automation has:

- Improved efficiency by over *95%.*  
- Ensured accurate and consistent reporting across *seven servers.*  
- Provided a scalable framework for automating similar reporting tasks in the future.  

---

## *Future Enhancements*

- Add a summary section to the email highlighting *critical issues,* if any.  
- Integrate advanced monitoring tools to further enhance reporting capabilities.  
- Implement a web-based dashboard for *real-time monitoring* of database health.  

---

## *Conclusion*

The automated solution for generating and sending the *Daily SQL Database Morning Report* has successfully replaced a manual, time-consuming process with a reliable and efficient system. This implementation not only saves time but also enhances the overall operational workflow. It is recommended to adopt similar automation strategies for other routine tasks to achieve comparable benefits.
