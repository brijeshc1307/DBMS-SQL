## ðŸ”· 1. What is Backup & Recovery?

| Term         | Description                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backup**   | A copy of your database (data and/or log) used to restore it if data is lost or corrupted.                       |
| **Recovery** | Restoring the database to a consistent and working state after failure (hardware, corruption, user error, etc.). |

## ðŸ”· 2. Types of Backups in SQL Server

| Backup Type         | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Full**            | Entire database (data + log at that moment). Required before other backups.          |
| **Differential**    | Only changes made since the last full backup. Faster and smaller.                    |
| **Transaction Log** | Captures all changes since the last log backup. Used for **point-in-time recovery**. |
| **File/Filegroup**  | Backs up specific data files or groups. Useful for very large databases.             |
| **Copy-only**       | A special full backup that doesnâ€™t affect differential/log chain.                    |

## ðŸ”· 3. SQL Server Backup Syntax

### âœ… A. Full Backup

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE SchoolDB
TO DISK = 'C:\Backups\SchoolDB_Full.bak';
```

### âœ… B. Differential Backup

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE SchoolDB
TO DISK = 'C:\Backups\SchoolDB_Diff.bak'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;
```

### âœ… C. Transaction Log Backup

```sql
BACKUP LOG SchoolDB
TO DISK = 'C:\Backups\SchoolDB_Log.trn';
```

---

## ðŸ”· 4. Recovery Syntax in SQL Server

### âœ… A. Restore Full Backup

```sql
RESTORE DATABASE SchoolDB
FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\SchoolDB_Full.bak'
WITH REPLACE;
```

### âœ… B. Restore Full + Differential Backup

```sql
-- Restore full backup (no recovery yet)
RESTORE DATABASE SchoolDB
FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\SchoolDB_Full.bak'
WITH NORECOVERY;

-- Restore differential backup
RESTORE DATABASE SchoolDB
FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\SchoolDB_Diff.bak'
WITH RECOVERY;
```

### âœ… C. Restore With Transaction Logs (Point-in-time Recovery)

```sql
-- Restore full
RESTORE DATABASE SchoolDB
FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\SchoolDB_Full.bak'
WITH NORECOVERY;

-- Restore log
RESTORE LOG SchoolDB
FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\SchoolDB_Log.trn'
WITH STOPAT = '2025-08-13 10:00:00',
     RECOVERY;
```

## ðŸ”· 5. Best Practices for Backup Strategy

| Strategy                           | Details                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Backup Daily**              | Base for all other backups                    |
| **Differential Every Few Hours**   | Saves space and time                          |
| **Log Backup Every 5-15 Minutes**  | Enables near real-time recovery               |
| **Test restores regularly**        | Ensure your backups actually work             |
| **Store backups offsite or cloud** | Protect against hardware failure or disasters |
| **Automate with SQL Server Agent** | Schedule backups using jobs                   |

## ðŸ”· 6. Backup & Recovery in Other DBMS

### âœ… MySQL

* Use `mysqldump`:

```bash
mysqldump -u root -p SchoolDB > SchoolDB.sql
```

* Restore:

```bash
mysql -u root -p SchoolDB < SchoolDB.sql
```

### âœ… PostgreSQL

* Use `pg_dump`:

```bash
pg_dump -U postgres SchoolDB > SchoolDB.sql
```

* Restore:

```bash
psql -U postgres SchoolDB < SchoolDB.sql
```

> PostgreSQL and MySQL donâ€™t have built-in log backups like SQL Server but support **binary logging** and **point-in-time recovery** with configuration.

## ðŸ”· 7. Verifying Backups

```sql
-- Check backup history
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM msdb.dbo.backupset
ORDER BY backup_finish_date DESC;
```

## ðŸ”· 8. Summary

| Action                 | Command                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Full Backup            | `BACKUP DATABASE ... TO DISK` |
| Differential Backup    | `WITH DIFFERENTIAL`           |
| Log Backup             | `BACKUP LOG ... TO DISK`      |
| Restore                | `RESTORE DATABASE ...`        |
| Point-in-time Recovery | `RESTORE LOG ... WITH STOPAT` |
